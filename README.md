# LeaFBench

This is the official code for our paper entitled "[SoK: Large Language Model Copyright Auditing via Fingerprinting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19843)". LeaFBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and compare various fingerprinting methods for large language models (LLMs). The project provides a unified interface for running, testing, and analyzing different models and algorithms, facilitating reproducible research and fair comparison.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for running the benchmark.
- `benchmark/`: Core benchmark logic, model interfaces, and implementations.
- `config/`: Configuration files for different experiments and benchmarks.
- `data/`: Datasets and auxiliary files used in experiments.
- `fingerprint/`: Fingerprinting methods and related utilities.
- `scripts/`: Shell scripts for running experiments and benchmarks.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.

## Environment Setup

**Install dependencies:**
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The pip may indicate that `nanogcg` and `gptqmodel` are not compatible with the `transformers` version. Please ignore this warning. We use `nanogcg=0.3.0` and `gptqmodel=2.2.0`, and `transformers=4.54.1`.

## Reproducing Experiments

- All configuration files required to reproduce the experiments are located in the `config/` directory. Each YAML file corresponds to a specific experiment or benchmark setting.
- All scripts for running experiments are provided in the `scripts/` directory. Simply execute the corresponding shell script to run an experiment. For example:
  ```bash
  bash scripts/trap.sh
  ```
  The results will be generated according to the configuration specified in the related config file.

For further details, please refer to the comments in the scripts and configuration files.

## Further Extensions

LeaFBench is designed to be easily extensible. You can add new models or fingerprinting methods by following the structure in the `benchmark/` and `fingerprint/` directories. Please refer to the [README for Benchmark](benchmark/README.md) and [README for Fingerprinting Methods](fingerprint/README.md) for guidance.

## Collections of Papers

We also provide a collection of papers about LLM fingerprinting in [Awesome-LLM-Fingerprinting](https://github.com/shaoshuo-ss/Awesome-LLM-Fingerprinting).
